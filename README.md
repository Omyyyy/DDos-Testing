# DDos-Testing
Python script for penetration testing.

# Installation and usage

Download 'ddos.py'. You can clone the repo with:

> git clone https://github.com/Omyyyy/DDos-Testing.git

Once downloaded, run the file. You can either:

Specify the URL from the command line with:
>   python ddos.py https://example.com

or simply run the script, where you will be given the prompt:
>   enter the url of the target page:

where you can enter the URL. Both work.

# Notice

Do not use this script for malicious purposes, it is against the law. If you do, it is entirely your judgement and decision; I bare no concequences. 

# Improvements over other similar scripts

The most popular of these scripts seems to be Ha3MrX's: https://github.com/Ha3MrX/DDos-Attack

This has not been updated in a very long time and you can see from the 'Issues' tab that there are quite a few problems. This script works on the latest Python version as of now (3.10) and will be supported if any changes are made.
